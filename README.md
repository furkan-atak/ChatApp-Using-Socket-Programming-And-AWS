# ChatApp-Using-Socket-Programming-And-AWS
  In the context of the project, a multi-client client-server structure has been implemented. After the user (Client) connects to the server with a user name that he/she determines, he/she can see other users (other clients) connected to the server in the users list. In addition, the user can create as many rooms as he wants. Other users can message collectively by joining these rooms. In addition, users who are not in the room can see who is in the room by clicking on the room in the room list. Each user can also perform private messaging with any other user, as well as file sharing in the desired format in private messaging. Finally, the program was tested by running the server on AWS (Amazon Web Service) and a connection was established over the remote server by entering the relevant ip address.
